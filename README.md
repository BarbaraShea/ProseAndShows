## Learnings and Issues

Some of the learnings we're taking away from this project are:
1. How to use Github in a team environment. Although we'd had experience working on a group project in the past, many of us found this project to be a little more difficult to use with Github. Having several folders and files meant that there was more room for file conflict. In particular, our .env file always got pushed up to the main branch, although it was listed in our gitignore. This means that group members' MySQL passwords were exposed, and it was also inconvenient to update that file after every pull from the main branch.
2. In our first meeting, we didn't have a clear vision for our UI and never really flushed the details of it. Creating Views without a real idea of what our pages should look like and what should go on them was difficult. Also, CSS was one of the last parts of the projects we completed, because it was difficult for us to all get on the same page about what the site should look like.
* Thoughtful delegation of tasks would have made for a better start.
